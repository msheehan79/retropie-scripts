# retropie-scripts

A few scripts primarily centered around expanding the xboxdrv universal controller calibration and mapping method for RetroPie explained in the docs here: https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/Universal-Controller-Calibration-&-Mapping-Using-xboxdrv

Updates include being able to configure controllers in a set order in an external config file, the scripts will choose the first 2 detected controllers based on the priority defined in this config.
